     * This method is the implementation of the interface Comparable<T> which allows
     * the cells to be compared to one another even if they are different types. As
     * implemented, empty cells are "less than" TextCell, DateCell and NumberCell.
     * 
     * One should override this implementation in the derived classes to get proper
     * sorting. Use "public int compareTo(Cell other)" when overriding.
     * 
     * Collections.sort(arr) will sort arr of type ArrayList<Cell>.
     * 
     * Collections.sort(arr, Collections.reverseOrder()) will sort it in reverse.
     * 
     * The sort order should be:
     *     empty
     *     numbers
     *     dates
     *     text
     * 
     * Parameters:
     *     other : This is the cell to which 'thi's' cell is being compared to.
     * Returns:
     *    -1 if this cell is less than the other cell. 
     *     0 if this cell is equal to other cell.
     *     1 if this cell is greater than the other cell.
